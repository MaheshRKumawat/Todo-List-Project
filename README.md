# Todo-List-Project

A simple todo list project where user can add todos.
The user can cross out what he/she have done by clicking on the task or delete it by hovering and hitting the tick icon. This project uses HTML, CSS, jQuery,javaScript, Font Awesome and Google Fonts
There is no database along with it, so if the user refreshes the page, all the todos will be vanished.
